Developer: Eóin O'Callaghan
Halite (named after the mineral) is a BitTorrent client based on Arvid Norberg's excellent libtorrent library from Rasterbar Software. The program also relies on the Boost libraries.

Features:
While still at an early state of development Halite is a functional BitTorrent client. So far its list of features is pretty standard but that is because I want to ensure it does the basic stuff well.

That said, it supports:

File selection and/or file priority specifications.
'Managed torrent' queue system.
Disk cache support.
Trackerless torrents (using the Mainline kademlia DHT protocol).
Magnet URIs.
Super-seeding.
uTorrent style multi-tracker announcement.
IP filtering with eMule style ipfilter.dat import.
Protocol Encryption support.
Translations of the UI into a number of languages through the help of volunteers. (if you wish to help with a translation then please do)
Minimise to tray with transfer rate summary.
Full Unicode support through UTF-8 and native Windows wide-char strings.
Login support where tracker requires it.
Ability to edit trackers specified in the torrent.
Transfer rate and connection limits both global and per-torrent.
Torrent file creation.
Port randomisation and forwarding (UnPlug and Play or NAT-PMP)
Compatible with UAC.
Shutdown scheduler.

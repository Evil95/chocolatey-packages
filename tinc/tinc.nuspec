    <summary>Tinc is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) daemon.</summary>
    <description>Tinc is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) daemon that uses tunneling and encryption to create
a secure private network between hosts on the Internet.
Because the tunnel appears to the IP level network code as a normal network device, there
is no need to adapt any existing software. The encrypted tunnels allows VPN sites to share
information with each other over the Internet without exposing any information to others.</description>

    <releaseNotes>Version 1.1pre11 released.

Added a “network” command to list or switch networks.
Switched to Ed25519 keys and the ChaCha-Poly1305 cipher for the new protocol.
AutoConnect is now a boolean option, when enabled tinc always tries to keep at least three meta-connections open.
The new protocol now uses UDP much more often.
Tinc “del” and “get” commands now return a non-zero exit code when they don’t find the requested variable.
Updated documentation.
Added a “DeviceStandby” option to defer running tinc-up until a working connection is made, and which on Windows will also change the network interface link status accordingly.
Tinc now tells the resolver to reload /etc/resolv.conf when it receives SIGALRM.
Improved error messages and event loop handling on Windows.
LocalDiscovery now uses local address learned from other nodes, and is enabled by default.
Added a “BroadcastSubnet” option to change the behavior of broadcast packets in router mode.
Added support for dotted quad notation in IPv6 (e.g. ::1.2.3.4).
Improved format of printed Subnets, MAC and IPv6 addresses.
Added a “—batch” option to force the tinc CLI to run in non-interactive mode.
Improve default Device selection on *BSD and Mac OS X.
Allow running tinc without RSA keys.
Thanks to Etienne Dechamps, Sven-Haegar Koch, William A. Kennington III, Baptiste Jonglez, Alexis Hildebrandt, Armin Fisslthaler, Franz Pletz, Alexander Ried and Saverio Proto for their contributions to this version of tinc.</releaseNotes>
